/**
 *  Here's the list of things that need to be done.
 *
 *  Last updated by Moshe Berman on October 13, 2013

Maintainance:
------------
- KCSefiraString needs to be refactored completely to emulate NSNumberFormatter or NSDateFormatter. The ideal would be an enum for ahskenaz/sefard format and a class that produces appropriate strings.
- KCZman needs to be implemented.

Unit Tests - these classes need to be tested.
-----------
- Sunrise/sunset methods in KCSunriseSunsetCalculator
- KCComplexZmanimCalendar
- KCZmanimCalendar
- Holiday methods in KCJewishCalendar.

 *  Thanks!
